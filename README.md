What is this project for?
=====
Many times I was asked to write a project which our organization wants to send some notifications to some/all customers. This message should be confirmed by some managers before sending.

We may want to send this notification via E-Mail, SMS, WhatsApp, RocketChat or any other media.
another difference is we may want to make sure that message has been delivered or not.

I wrote this library to manage basic functionalities of this kind of projects. Implementation of `send()`, `checkDelivery()`, UserManagement, Web Pages should be done in an outer project.

You can see an Example below:

pom.xl
-
```aidl
TODO: write sample pom here
```

Config
-
```aidl
TODO: write sample Config here
```

etc.
